	<h2> Cru </h2>
	<p class = "body"> Cru is a non-denominational christian student group dedicated to providing a caring community to all students that desire it, christian or not. Every week, I lead a bible study with other members on campus. Pictured right is this year's cookie bake-off between the Men's and Women's bible studies for my area of campus. I also help plan and execute many of our overnight events, such as our annual Fall Getaway retreat in Lake James, Indianna. My sophomore year, I spent the whole summer in Ocean City, New Jersey on a leadership development retreat/mission trip with over 60 other students. I have also taken two alternative spring break trips to Havana, Cuba to install water filters in impoverished communities and help other students as a Spanish translator.

	<h2> Community Outreach </h2>
	<p class = "body"> This semester, I helped my girlfriend start a brand new student org called M-Mates, Affiliates for Prison Reform. We are dedicated to improve America's prisons by increasing their ability to rehabilitate and prepare prisoners for re-entry rather than the current "catch and release" model that continues to fail. M-Mates consists of two major projects as of right now. Pictured left is the Lookout Project, which aims to help end opoid overdose in recently re-entered individuals by providing Narcan, an opoid overdose reversal agent clinically proven to save lives. Pictured right is the project I am working on known as Out of the Box, which aims to prepare inmates for reentry by teaching them technical skills to gain an edge in the current job market.
