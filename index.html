	<h2> About Me </h2>
	<p class = "body"> 
	Hi There! My name is Evan Hogan, and thank you for visiting my website! I designed everything you see here from scratch, no third party software, just HTML, CSS, and an editor. Here, you will find everything about me, including my education, accomplishments, interests, hobbies, and organizations.
	<br><br>
	I Currently reside in Northville, Michigan (right) with my younger sister, two black ladbradors, mother, and father. Pictured left are my housemates past and present, 8 of which live with me at the University of Michigan in Ann Arbor In my off time, I enjoy video gaming, running, swimming, lifting weights, and watching classic movies with my housmates. I also enjoy combat sports every now and then, and have taken more time than I care to admit customizing my paintball gear. 
	<br><br>
	I am most passionate about helping individuals, groups, and organizations unlock their maximum potential. Nothing is more gratiying than being the catalyst for increased productivity and positive change. As a result, I've devoted my whole life to helping others, frequently volunteering and spending my freetime to help good causes. Please, take some time to click around and learn the more specific details about my life!

	<h2> Fun Facts </h2>
	<p class = "body"> Something cool about me is that I spent most of my childhood in Mexico. When I was six weeks old, my dad took my whole family down to Monterrey, Nuevo Leon Mexico for the better part of ten years. During my time there, I attended a gradeschool ran by the American Embassy, and met kids from all around the world. However, I was still, surprisingly one of the only Americans I knew. Pictured left is "La Silla," a mountain in Las Sierra Madres mountain range. This shot was taken out my eastern window of my old house. Pictured right is the beach we used to visit all the time, where I obtained my love of swimming. Since Mexico, I've been fascinated with learning more about other cultures and how they interact with eachother. My family has also retained and continues to practice many of the Mexican cultural values we obtained.
