	<h2> UMSI Data Analysis </h2>
	<p class = "body"> I am persuing a dual degree wiht two majors and a minor. My primary school is the Univerity of Michigan School of Information, or UMSI for short. My track is known as Information Analysis, which is similar in nature to data analytics or data sceince. This track is all about using technology to solve problems by analyzing, manipulating, and visualizing numeric and qualitative data. Most of the time, this means applying statistical modeling, machine learning techniques, and advanced graphing to find hidden meanings inside of complex, massive data sets. Recently, I completed an individual final project that empirically proved that books are better than their movie adaptations. This past semester, I worked on a team project that uses machine learning analytics to classify and predict crimes from a real police data set in San Diego. However, my technical expertise is not limited to this kind of work. I am currently in a graphic design class learning about Photoshop and Illustrator, and am also learning how to build websites through my web design class.

	<h2> LSA International Studies ISNC </h2>
	<p class = "body"> My secondary school is the University of Michigan School of Literature, Sceince, and the Arts. From here, I will be obtaining a major in International Studies and a minor in Spanish Language and Hispanic culture. My major track is in International Security, Norms, and Cooperation. Most of my classes pertain to global security issues, such as human trafficking, and how the international community ought to approach these issues in a nuanced and collaborative manner. I have taken classes about how international institutions like the U.N are structured and what they do, and how global phenomena like terrorism and disease affect communities. My Spanish education tends to follow these same motifs as well, just with a focus on Latin America. I recently completed a 15 page thesis in Spanish about the Pinochet Regime in Chile, as well as a 15 minute presentation about the cultural and military complexities of the Mexican Revolution.
