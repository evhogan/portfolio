	<h2> Detroit Crime Commission </h2>
	<p class = "body"> My most recent professional experience was obtained last summer at the Detroit Crime Commission (DCC) as a Data Analyst Intern. The DCC was started by two former FBI agents, former FBI Detroit Division Chief Andy Arena, pictured right, and one of his right-hand-men Ron Reddy. The DCC works hand in hand with the Detroit Police Department and Detroit FBI as a civilian ally to the security, intelligence, and investigative processes. Some of my duties included direct assistence towards security assessments for high-profile events in Detroit such as the Motorcity Pride 2019 parade. However, my primary responsibility was writing computer programs that converted their file lockers of criminal investigations and security assessments into a single, searchable, and compact data structure. At the end of the summer, I wrote a scraping algorithm that pulls relevant fields from thousands of reports in a little less than three minutes. I also wrote a GUI that assists DCC analysts in exploring the data cache that the scraping algorithm creates.

	<h2> Auto-Owners Summer Internship </h2>
	<p class = "body"> I will be spending this summer in Lansing with Auto-Owners insurance company. I will be working directly under the head of research and development in the actuarial division, creating predictive models to determine business and claim outcomes for the forseeable future. I will be further developing my python skills as well as gaining hands on instruction with the more advanced machine learning libraries, such as Keras and TensorFlow. The first few weeks will be primarily paid instruction time with the tools of the job, and the rest will hopefully be exclusively hands-on learning in the data analytics and data sceince industry alongside very accomplished data professionals. I am still a little shakey on the nitty-gritty details, so I will be sure to keep you guys updated along the way!</p>
